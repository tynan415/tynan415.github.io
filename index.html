          <p>Hi im Squidward I've recently moved here to the moon to get away from my annoying neighbors spongebob and patrick.
           Unfortunately for me one of them has followed me here. I need your help to keep them away from my house.
           If you wouldn't mind placing these clones of mine by left clicking in the yellow box im sure
           the music they play will keep patrick at bay. If too many patricks get by I wont get any piece and quiet
           so stop as many as you can. Oh and another thing if my clones are in close contact with a patrick for too long
           they will disappear.
          </p>
